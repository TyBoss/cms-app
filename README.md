# A project that I found online and using it as a playground for learning

The project initially connected to an older version of CosmicJS and pulled content
from a sample project hosted on the CMS. I updated the version and will tinker
with the application for my purposes.

NOTE: the npm development script uses nodemon; if error is encountered, nodemon may need to be reinstalled depending on the version of node running.
